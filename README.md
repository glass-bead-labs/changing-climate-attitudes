College Student Data was collected via hand-entered paper forms, or Qualtrics.
All Mechanical Turk data was collected via Qualtrics.

In brief, the following terms are used to describe each dataset:

- Where collected:
    - **cco** (Climate Change Online): Data collected via Amazon Mechanical
      Turk
    - **UCp** Collected at University of California, Berkeley *on paper*
    - **UCo** Collected at University of California, Berkeley using an *online
      survey* (but still in a testing room)
    - **UT** Collected at University of Texas, Brownsville (on paper)
- Intervention:
    - **mech**: Data were collected before and after a presentation of the
      written description of the climate change mechanism.
    - **mech+stats**: Data were collected before and after an extended
      curriculum including surprising numerical statistics and the description
      of the mechanism.
    - **core_intervention**: Whatever was given to *all* participants (or
      alternatively, all columns represented with some NAs, e.g., for
      no-pretest).
    - **delayed_test**: delayed post-test data.
    - **full_intervention**: Sometimes the core was redundantly included along
      with delayed_test data.
- Desiderata:
    - **notext**: Columns containing free text responses are not included. Ask
      Dav for this info if needed.

The following are organized based on the Ranney & Clark (2016) TopiCS paper.
Note that in some cases, exported data have been reverse coded. This is noted
explicitly. If real knowledge scores have not been computed, python code is
provided in `codes.py` that can perform this computation.

- Experiment 2 - initial experiments at UC Berkeley and UT Brownsville:
    - UCp_mech_core_intervention_notext.csv (85 students)
    - UT_mech_core_intervention_notext.csv (41 students)
- Experiment 3 - online replication / extension at UC Berkeley:
    - UCo_mech_core_intervention_notext.csv (79 students with valid posttest
      and followup data, `_pre` data avilable only for `knwgbl`)
    - UCo_mech_full_intervention_notext.csv (38 students, all `_pre` data
      available from pre-screening survey - if unmarked, data is "pre")
    - UCo_mech_prescreening.csv (324 students, source of `_pre` data above,
      question text is on second line)
- Experiment 4 - online replication / extension on MTurk:
    - *`gw2_1`, `evo2_5`, and `evo2_6` are reverse-coded*
    - cco_mech_core_intervention_notext.csv (38 valid participants)
    - cco_mech_delayed_test_notext.csv (28 completed)
- Experiment 5 - Expanded high school curriculum:
    - HS_mech+stats_full_intervention.csv (63 students)
