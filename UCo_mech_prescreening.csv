I know that Global Warming is happening right now as a result of Green House Gas effect (ozone gas, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, etc.). Global Warming is happening since people act carelessly. We commute by cars which cause a lot of green house gases increase over years. Keeling Curve has shown that carbon dioxide has increased tremendously. Thus, we have to do something about it, such as walking to school, recycling bottles, saving energy to reduce the damage of Global warming.",1,6,Calculus II - Math 16B,1,683,1,6,8,7,6,6,6,8,8,8,7,6,7,8,7,5,6,6,6,6,7,1,7,7,49,1,7,6,7,7,6,6,6,5,7,,,6,5,4,7,6,7,6,5,7
